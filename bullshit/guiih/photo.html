        Ahaha, hohoho, shit, no <br>
        Oh, fuck<br>
        Aw, man, tell the label<br>
        Tell the label<br>
        <br>
        New week, no sleep, no key, I lost 'em in the street<br>
        And no, I can't see without you<br>
        Billy and Badu, I'll follow you into any room<br>
        'Cause I can't hear without you<br>
        (Shit gets weird when you talk about it)<br>
        <br>
        Lit in line, smile for the photo ID<br>
        Inside, that's where we can be free<br>
        Your highness, caught you sippin' on lean<br>
        Reminds me that's how it's 'posed to be<br>
        <br>
        Bitch, you fell asleep too fast<br>
        I want my money back<br>
        But I can't deal without you<br>
        Stuck behind your beat, I kick my feet up<br>
        You're so mean<br>
        But I can't dream without you<br>
        (Shit gets weird when you talk about it)<br>
        <br>
        Lit in line, smile for the photo ID<br>
        Inside, that's where we can be free<br>
        Your highness (Yeah, ahaha)<br>
        Caught you sippin' on lean (Aight, pictures of my)<br>
        Reminds me that's how it's 'posed to be (Yeah-yeah-yeah, okay, okay)<br>
        <br>
        Aight, pictures of my friends on my Instagram<br>
        And photos of my toes on my OnlyFans<br>
        And visuals in these frames look better<br>
        Than the ones that she posted on Facebook<br>
        <br>
        I'm ready when you wanna point that, shoot that, pop that<br>
        Polaroid that, screw that, chop that lean<br>
        The shit that only happened in my wildest dreams<br>
        The shit we talk about and listen to behind the screens<br>
        And I be tryna stream consciousness (Ayy)<br>
        <br>
        Baby, you be tryna stream songs like this<br>
        I told you I just want to remember it<br>
        I told you I be tryna create memories<br>
        <br>
        But everybody 'round me want a check<br>
        Only thing that keep me out of that bag full of that white<br>
        Or that bottle full of that red is photos on my desk<br>
        Only thing that keep me out of my head when I'm in bed<br>
        Is the photos on the wall back when we had it all<br>
        So I be tryna keep track of it (Ayy)<br>
        <br>
        Catch it and it vanish like a magic trick (Ayy)<br>
        'Specially when we was on Xans and shit (Ayy)<br>
        Truthfully, I don't even understand that shit, another stanza<br>
        My bitch an actor, my homie managin', makin' sure that they payin' us<br>
        I'm just a natural when it come to pickin' the brands up<br>
        And I'm only twenty-five, G<br>
        Tell that bitch to take a picture for the photo ID (Fuck)<br>
        <br>
        Lit in line, smile for the photo ID<br>
        Inside, that's where we can be free<br>
        Your highness, caught you sippin' on lean<br>
        Reminds me that's how it's 'posed to be<br>

        Ooh, baby, turn off the light<br>
        You're gonna make my body fry<br>
        Ooh, baby, don't you cry<br>
        Shit gets weird when you talk about it<br>
        Ooh, baby, turn off the light<br>
