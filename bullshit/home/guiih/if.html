    <p>Letra:</p>

    <p>
        I had to let a little off, yeah <br>
        I had to cut the pill off, yeah<br>
        But if we bein' real though, yeah<br>
        Nah, I don't never feel nothin' (yeah, yeah)<br>
        <br>
        I'm steady jumpin' the gun, yeah, I do it for fun<br>
        You act like you do it for real, but, no, you is not one of us<br>
        You never could come inside of this buildin' we run<br>
        Inside of this world we run, we do it for us<br>
        No, we don't fuck with one of them at all, at all<br>
        We don't fuck with you at all<br>
        <br>
        No, I won't pick up your calls, uh<br>
        No, l don't like you at all<br>
        I kind of wanna see you fall<br>
        I keep on chasin' the highs, I know I could never get back<br>
        So I'm always on low<br>
        And I got eyes on the back of my head, I got eyes everywhere<br>
        So I know where you go (yeah, yeah)<br>
        <br>
        I could drop ties in this bitch<br>
        Drop like flies in this bitch<br>
        I cut ties in this bitch<br>
        I'll cut ties in your face<br>
        Yeah, cut you like a lace<br>
        Nothin' I do could be replaced<br>
        That's why I'm livin' out in space<br>
        <br>
        I take the money to another level<br>
        I take the plane to another level<br>
        I take the heights to a newer level<br>
        I take gettin' high to a newer level<br>
        Keep diggin' your grave, I'll pass you the shovel, yeah<br>
        I ain't mean to burst your bubble<br>
        But I ain't into makin' change, I'ma stay the same, bring it to my level<br>
        <br>
        If we bein' real, I don't know how to feel<br>
        I been overseas (I been overseas), you been on your knees<br>
        You been beggin': Please (you been beggin', Please), it's nothin' left to see<br>
        It's nothin' left to feel, why you in the field? (Why you in the field?)<br>
        Why you so real? (Why you so real?)<br>
        Tell me how you feel, huh (tell me how you feel)<br>
        Why you make me feel the way I feel?<br>
        Will you make me feel better? (Will you make me feel better?)<br>
        Always clashin' heads, yeah<br>
        With somebody who think they know better (who think they know better)<br>
        <br>
        Who the fuck is you? Got better things to do<br>
        I don't got time to waste, I just need my space<br>
        It's a couple things that I can feel, but I can't feel my face<br>
        It's a couple things that I wish I could, but I can't replace<br>
        I think it's a sickness, bein' so selfish, yeah<br>
        I'm in need of a witness<br>
        They always tell me, yeah, "Never forget this"<br>
        I forget everything, I don't even know where my tip is<br>
        And I'll change everything, I don't know how l'll top this<br>
