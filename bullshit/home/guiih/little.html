    <p>Letra:</p>

    <p>    
        Breathing in the dark<br>
        Lying on its side<br>
        The ruins of the day<br>
        Painted with a scar<br>
        And the more I straighten out<br>
        The less it wants to try<br>
        The feelings start to rot<br>
        One wink at a time<br>
        <br>
        Oh, forgiving who you are<br>
        For what you stand to gain<br>
        Just know that if you hide<br>
        It doesn't go away<br>
        When you get out of bed<br>
        Don't end up stranded<br>
        Horrified with each stone<br>
        On the stage<br>
        My little dark age<br>
        <br>
        Picking through the cards<br>
        Knowing what's nearby<br>
        The carvings on the face<br>
        Say they find it hard<br>
        And the engine's failed again<br>
        All limits of disguise<br>
        The humor's not the same<br>
        Coming from denial<br>
        <br>
        Oh, I grieve in stereo<br>
        The stereo sounds strange<br>
        I know that if you hide<br>
        It doesn't go away<br>
        If you get out of bed<br>
        And find me standing all alone<br>
        Open-eyed<br>
        Burn the page<br>
        My little dark age<br>
        <br>
        I grieve in stereo<br>
        The stereo sounds strange<br>
        You know that if it hides<br>
        It doesn't go away<br>
        If I get out of bed<br>
        You'll see me standing all alone<br>
        Horrified<br>
        On the stage<br>
        My little dark age<br>
        <br>
        Giddy with delight<br>
        Seeing what's to come<br>
        The image of the dead<br>
        Dead ends in my mind<br>
        <br>
        Policemen swear to God<br>
        Love's seeping from their guns<br>
        I know my friends and I<br>
        Would probably turn and run<br>
        If you get out of bed<br>
        Come find us heading for the bridge<br>
        Bring a stone<br>
        All the rage<br>
        My little dark age<br>
        <br>
        I grieve in stereo<br>
        The stereo sounds strange<br>
        I know that if you hide<br>
        It doesn't go away<br>
        If you get out of bed<br>
        And find me standing all alone<br>
        Open-eyed<br>
        Burn the page<br>
        My little dark age<br>
        <br>
        All alone<br>
        Open-eyed<br>
        Burn the page<br>
        My little dark age<br>
