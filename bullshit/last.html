    <p>Letra:</p>

    <p>
        You try to run me through <br>
        Hold on, think again<br>
        Don't you know what you're starting?<br>
        But you sure ain't got a clue<br>
        How bad this will go<br>
        Don't you know, know my art? (Art of war)<br>
        <br>
        And as you look to the horizon, not a cloud<br>
        But then stormy weather's caught you cold<br>
        Seems like it crept up out of nowhere all around you<br>
        It's not quite what you foretold<br>
        <br>
        You'll never see it coming<br>
        You'll see that my mind is too fast for eyes<br>
        You're done in<br>
        By the time it's hit you, your last surprise<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        <br>
        You think you got your game<br>
        Planned out to a T<br>
        Yet I'm two steps ahead, yeah<br>
        So, you step into my way<br>
        Stand down, it's a trap<br>
        One more step and you're dead (yeah you're dead)<br>
        <br>
        Why just a picosecond ago, clear blue skies?<br>
        But now lightning's struck your last resolve<br>
        It's not an accident that no one hears your cries<br>
        As your last strength seems to dissolve<br>
        <br>
        You'll never see it coming<br>
        You'll see that my mind is too fast for eyes<br>
        You're done in<br>
        By the time it's hit you, your last surprise<br>
        <br>
        I'm coming for you<br>
        My game's always so fast, so fine<br>
        You're spun in by the net<br>
        You didn't catch it in time<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        <br>
        Better think about your <br>
        Are you sure your next move's the right one for yo<br>u?
        Are you sure you won't get outmaneuvered<br>
        Again and again, my friend?<br>
        <br>
        You'll never see it coming<br>
        You'll see that my mind is too fast for eyes<br>
        You're done in<br>
        By the time it's hit you, your last surprise<br>
        <br>
        I'm coming for you<br>
        My game's always so fast, so fine<br>
        You're spun in by the <br>
        You didn't catch it in time<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
        Ooh, ooh, ooh
