    <p>
        Let's say sunshine for everyone <br>
        But as far as I can remember<br>
        We've been migratory animals<br>
        Living under changing weather<br>
        <br>
        Someday we will foresee obstacles<br>
        Through the blizzard, through the blizzard<br>
        Today we will sell our uniform<br>
        Live together, live together<br>
        <br>
        We played hide and seek in waterfalls<br>
        We were younger, we were younger<br>
        We played hide and seek in waterfalls<br>
        We were younger, we were younger<br>
        <br>
        We played hide and seek in waterfalls<br>
        We were younger, we were younger<br>
        We played hide and seek in waterfalls<br>
        We were younger, we were younger<br>
        <br>
        Someday we will foresee obstacles<br>
        Through the blizzard, through the blizzard
